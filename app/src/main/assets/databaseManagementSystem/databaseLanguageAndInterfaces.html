  <h2>Database Language</h2>
  <p>Database languages are used to read, update and store data in a database. There are several such languages that can be used for this purpose; one of them is SQL (Structured Query Language).</p>
  <h4>Types of Database Language</h4>
  <img src="dataLanguage.jpg" alt="faild">
  <h4>Data Definition Language  </h4>
  <p>Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are used to classify the database structure or schema. It is a type of language that allows the DBA or user to depict and name those entities, attributes, and relationships that are required for the application along with any associated integrity and security constraints. Here are the lists of tasks that come under DDL:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>CREATE</strong> - used to create objects in the database</li>
      <li><strong>ALTER</strong> - used to alters the structure of the database</li>
      <li><strong>DROP</strong> - used to delete objects from the database</li>
      <li><strong>TRUNCATE</strong> - used to remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed</li>
      <li><strong>COMMENT</strong> - used to add comments to the data dictionary</li>
      <li><strong>RENAME</strong> - used to rename an object</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Data Manipulation Language</h4>
    <p>A language that offers a set of operations to support the fundamental data manipulation operations on the data held in the database. Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements are used to manage data within schema objects. Here are the lists of tasks that come under DML:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SELECT</strong> - It retrieves data from a database</li>
      <li><strong>INSERT</strong> - It inserts data into a table</li>
      <li><strong>UPDATE</strong> - It updates existing data within a table</li>
      <li><strong>DELETE</strong> - It deletes all records from a table, the space for the records remain</li>
      <li><strong>MERGE</strong> - UPSERT operation (insert or update)</li>
      <li><strong>CALL</strong> - It calls a PL/SQL or Java subprogram</li>
      <li><strong>EXPLAIN PLAN</strong> - It explains the access path to data</li>
      <li><strong>LOCK TABLE</strong> - It controls concurrency</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Data Control Language</h4>
    <p>There are two other forms of database sub-languages. The Data Control Language (DCL) is used to control privilege in Databases. To perform any operation in the database, such as for creating tables, sequences, or views, we need privileges. Privileges are of two types,</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>System</strong> - creating a session, table, etc. are all types of system privilege.</li>
      <li><strong>Object</strong> - any command or query to work on tables comes under object privilege. DCL is used to define two commands. These are:</li>
      <li><strong>Grant</strong> - It gives user access privileges to a database.</li>
      <li><strong>Revoke</strong> - It takes back permissions from the user.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Transaction Control Language</h4>
    <p>Transaction Control statements are used to run the changes made by DML statements. It allows statements to be grouped into logical transactions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>COMMIT</strong> - It saves the work done</li>
      <li><strong>SAVEPOINT</strong> - It identifies a point in a transaction to which you can later roll back</li>
      <li><strong>ROLLBACK</strong> - It restores the database to original since the last COMMIT</li>
      <li><strong>SET TRANSACTION</strong> - It changes the transaction options like isolation level and what rollback segment to use</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>What Does DBMS Interface Mean?</h2>
  <p>A database management system (DBMS) interface is a user interface which allows for the ability to input queries to a database without using the query language itself. A DBMS interface could be a web client, a local client that runs on a desktop computer, or even a mobile app.</p>
  <h5>The different user-friendly interfaces provided by the database management system (DBMS) are as follows &minus;</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Menu-Based interfaces.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Forms-based interfaces.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Graphical user interfaces.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Natural language interfaces.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Speech input and output interfaces.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Interfaces for parametric users.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Interfaces for the database administrator (DBA).</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss the user-friendly interfaces provided by the DBMS in detail.</p>
<h4>Menu-based interfaces</h4>
<p>These interfaces contain the lists of options through which the user is able to send the request.</p>
<p>The Pull-down menus are a very popular technique in web-based user interfaces.</p>
<p>These types of interfaces are mainly used by the web browsing users and web clients.</p>
<h4>Forms-based interfaces</h4>
<p>These types of interfaces are displaying a form to each user. The user is able to fill the entries to insert new data.</p>
<p>These forms are usually designed and programmed by na&iuml;ve users as interfaces for recorded transactions.</p>
<p>User who wants to submit the online information by filling and submitting the details are going to use this type of interface</p>
<p>To create accounts on a website, or enrolling into some institution etc are also preferred to use this interface.</p>
<h4>Graphical user interfaces</h4>
<p>A graphical user interface contains a diagrammatic form that comprises a schema to the user.</p>
<p>The user asks a query by manipulating the diagram. These interfaces use the mouse as a pointing device to pick certain parts of the diagram.</p>
<p>These types of interfaces are used by the users who use electronic gadgets like mobile phones and touch screens.</p>
<h4>Natural language interfaces</h4>
<p>These interfaces accept the request from the user and try to interpret it.</p>
<p>The natural languages interfaces have their own schema which is like the database conceptual schema.</p>
<p>The search engines these days are using natural language interfaces.</p>
<p>The user can use these search engines to accept the words and retrieve the related information.</p>
<h4>Speech input and output interfaces</h4>
<p>These types of interfaces accept speech as an input and output the speech as a result.</p>
<p>These types of interfaces are mostly used in the inquiry for telephone directory or to get the flight information over the smart gadgets etc.</p>
<h4>Interfaces for parametric users</h4>
<p>Parametric users like bank tellers have a small set of operations that they must perform repeatedly.</p>
<p>These interfaces contain some commands to perform a request with minimum keystrokes.</p>
<p>These interfaces can be used in bank transactions to deposit or withdraw of money.</p>
<h4>Interfaces for DBA</h4>
<p>These interfaces contain some commands for creating accounts, to manipulate the database to perform some operations on the database.</p>
<p>These interfaces are specially used by the database administrators.</p>
<p>The types of user friendly interfaces provided by the DBMS are shown below in the diagram &minus;</p>
